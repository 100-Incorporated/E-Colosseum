# E-Colosseum
The e-Colosseum is a platform for players to compete against each other in a variety of intelligence/skill-based games. The focus is on self-improvement: with a monetary incentive at stake, users may be more motivated to improve their skills. 
The platform will also offer a portal for stocks trading, a modern-day simulation of gladiator betting. Ideally, this will transition into a feature to bet on other users' performance in the e-Colosseum's games.

## Getting Started
To start a development server, run `ng serve --open` in the project directory. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
Run `ng build` to build the project.
